Package Groups

Currently groups and packages are maintained in the patterns directory 
in pattern files. All changes need to be done only to the pattern files.
Other files are autogenerated.

- Edit pattern files and make the desired changes
- Verfiy integrity of the changes using a syntax checker such as xmllint


To update the package:
- change the pattern files (xml)
- Verify your changes
- Bump the version in the VERSION file
- commit and push
- Do not change the ChangeLog file, this is generated using a script
  run 'python scripts/gitlog2changelog.py'
- commit and push
- run 'make tag'
- run 'make dist'
- Submit the newly generated tar
